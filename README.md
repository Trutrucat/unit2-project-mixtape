## Summary
Mixtape is a web application where upon account creation users are given an empty playlist to populate with songs. They can edit and delete songs from thier playlist. They can also view other app user's playlists using links on a community page. The idea behind this app is to encourage users to make a very personalized playlist that represents their lives including some of their earliest remembered favorite songs. The idea would be that while listening to thier personal "mixtape" the user would be reminded of memories throughout their life.

## Stretch Goals
I would like to add a chat feature so that users could chat with each other about thier favorite songs and bond over why they are meaninful to them. I would also like to get enough users to add a friending feature. I'd also like to add the ability to easily adust the order of the songs in the list. And it would be nice to have the app be able to populate the information about artist, decade, and genre of the songs.
